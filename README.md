# 🚀 Space Defence Game - Digital Logic Design Project

🎮 A digital mini-game inspired by space defense, built using logic gates and timers.

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate a space defense game where players eliminate space monsters using logic circuits.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- A 555 timer is used in **Astable Mode** to generate clock pulses.
- Two decoders are connected to timers and inverters for active-low output.
- NAND + Inverter gates group monsters.
- Switches act as weapons to eliminate monsters (logic = 1).
- OR gates check if a monster has been eliminated.
- A 7-segment display + buzzer count eliminations.

## 📦 Included Files
- `Space defence.pdf 2.pdf`: Full documentation including circuit diagram, truth table, and PCB design.

## 🔩 Components
- 555 Timer (Astable)
- Decoders
- NAND, OR, and Inverter Gates
- LEDs
- Switches
- SSD (Seven Segment Display)
- Buzzer

## 🧠 Logic Tables
Each group can only hold a maximum of 2 monsters. Elimination is confirmed when logic output = 0.
